There are a few tables that you may want to edit if you install certain mods:

ut_type - This stores a list of each game description (Deathmatch, CTF, etc.)
          and the type of game.  If you were to install a mod that includes a
          deathmatch style game called "Death Arena" for example, you'd want
          to include an entry in the ut_type table with tp_desc set to match
          the game type description ("Death Arena") and tp_type set to "1"
          which corresponds to the type deathmatch.  The game will automatically
          add any non-existent game types it encounters, but all stats will be
          added to the "Other" type category until modified.

ut_weapons - This is a list of all weapons found in the game including the
             descriptors for each as found in the logs.  Again, the game will
             automatically add any new weapons found in the logs here, but
             preferably these should be added before you process the logs.
             wp_type is the log description for the weapon, such as
             "DamTypeFlakShell".  In the wp_desc field you would want to set
             this to "Flak Cannon".  Since the flak shell is the weapon's
             secondary function you'll want to set wp_secondary to 1.
             Set wp_secondary to 2 for tertiary functions such as the shock
             combo, though this will still be calculated into the totals for
             secondary functions.

ut_items - A list of any items picked up in the game, including weapons and ammo.
           If new items are added to your game you'll want to edit the item's
           description (it_desc) to an appropriate name (such as "Damage Amplifer"
           for the "UDamagePickup").

The rest of the tables read descriptions from these three tables and should never
require any modification.
