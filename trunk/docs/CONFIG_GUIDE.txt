========== Logs Configuration =================================================
===============================================================================
     Log Path: Path to where log files are stored on the stats server (i.e. the 
               local storage path).  When using FTP to download logs, this is 
               also where the logs are saved.  This can be a relative or 
               absolute path.  Examples:
                 ./Logs/                 Logs are located in the Logs directory 
                                         within your main UTStatsDB directory.
                 /UT2004/UserLogs/       Logs are located in /UT2004/Logs on the 
                                         same drive as UTStatsDB.
                 C:\\UT2004\\UserLogs\\  Logs are located in C:\UT2004\UserLogs 
                                         on a Windows system.

  Backup Path: Path to where log files are backed up after successfully parsing. 
               Leave blank to not backup.  This can be a relative or absolute 
               path.  Example:
                 ./Backup/  Logs are backed up to the Backup directory within 
                            your main UTStatsDB directory.

   Log Prefix: Prefix of log files, before the timestamp or port number.  The 
               defaults by game type are:
                    UT3: Stats-
                 UT2003: Stats_
                 UT2004: Stats_
                   UT99: Unreal.ngLog.

      No Port: True/False - Set true if the log filenames do not contain the 
               server port number.  This should usually be set false.

  Chat Prefix: Prefix of chat log files, excluding timestamp or port number.

 Require Chat: Set to true if only logs with matching chat logs should be 
               processed.  This ensures that game logs are not processed before 
               the corresponding chat logs are closed.

   FTP Server: FTP server address, including ftp:// or ftps// and port number 
               (:21 default).

 Passive Mode: True/False - Set true to use FTP passive mode, false for active 
               mode.  Generally safe to leave set to true.

     FTP User: FTP server username.

 FTP Password: FTP server password.

     FTP Path: Path to logs on FTP server - relative to path at login.

 Demorec Path: Path to demorec logs on FTP server - relative to path at login.

 Default Type: This sets the default type to use for unknown game types.  Set to 
               whichever the server most frequently runs.  Recognized game types 
               are: 0=Other, 1=DM, 2=CTF, 3=BR, 4=TDM, 5=AS, 6=ONS, 7=DD, 8=MU, 
               9=INV, 10=LMS

    Team Game: True/False - Set true to have new game types default as team games.

     All Logs: True/False - Set false to leave the most recent log on the 
               server.  Mainly used for certain UT2003 loggeers which did not 
               generate a .tmp file before creating the final log file.

  Multi-check: True/False - Set true for UTStatsDB to handle calculating multi-
               kills.  Some loggers do not log multi-kills.
